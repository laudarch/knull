# Knull and Knulleye Project

![We are Knull](imgs/dashboard.png)
## Overview

The **Knull** and **Knulleye** projects are designed for network scanning and web content retrieval. Knull focuses on scanning IP ranges using Masscan and fetching HTTP/HTTPS content, while Knulleye takes screenshots of the web pages identified by Knull. These tools are useful for security researchers, penetration testers, and network administrators who need to analyze web services and their content.

## Features

### Knull
- **Masscan Integration**: Scans specified CIDR ranges for open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- **Multithreaded Fetching**: Concurrently fetches web page content from discovered services.
- **Session Management**: Allows resuming scans from where they left off in case of interruptions.
- **Custom SSL Handling**: Bypasses SSL certificate verification for HTTPS requests.

### Knulleye
- **Selenium Integration**: Takes full-page screenshots of web pages.
- **Session Management**: Tracks processed URLs to avoid reprocessing.
- **Headless Browser**: Operates in headless mode for efficiency.
- **Filename Sanitization**: Ensures valid filenames based on URLs.

### Helper Scripts
- **count_ips.sh**: Counts the total number of IP addresses in a file containing CIDR ranges.
- **extract_cidr.sh**: Extracts CIDR blocks from a given input file.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3**
- **Masscan**: For network scanning.
- **Selenium**: For web page screenshotting.
- **ChromeDriver**: Required for Selenium to control Chrome.
- **Nmap**: Used by `count_ips.sh` to list IPs.

## Usage

### Knull

To scan a list of CIDR ranges and fetch web content:

```bash
./knull.py cidr_ranges.txt session_name
```

- **cidr_ranges.txt**: File containing CIDR ranges (one per line).
- **session_name**: Name of the session/project.

### Knulleye

To take screenshots of URLs discovered by Knull:

```bash
./knulleye.py [file] session_name
```

- **file**: optional file containing urls to scan,(useful when you already have urls).
- **session_name**: Name of the session/project.

### Helper Scripts

#### Count IPs

To count the total number of IP addresses in a file containing CIDR ranges:

```bash
./tools/count_ips.sh cidr_ranges.txt
```

- **cidr_ranges.txt**: File containing CIDR ranges (one per line).

#### Extract CIDR

To extract CIDR blocks from a file:

```bash
./tools/extract_cidr.sh input_file output_file
```

- **input_file**: File containing CIDR ranges.
- **output_file**: File to store the extracted CIDR ranges (one per line).

## Session Management

The **Knull** and **Knulleye** projects use a session-based approach to organize and store output files. Each session (or project) is stored in its own directory under the `Sessions` folder. This allows you to manage multiple scans or projects independently, keeping their data isolated and organized.

### Directory Structure

Hereâ€™s the directory structure for a session named `session_name`:

```
Sessions/                  # Root directory for all sessions
  session_name/            # Directory for a specific session/project
    ips.txt                # List of discovered IPs with ports
    scanner_session.json   # JSON file tracking the session state (completed/in-progress CIDR ranges)
    masscan/               # Directory containing Masscan output files
    screenshots/           # Directory containing screenshots taken by Knulleye
    results/               # Directory containing HTTP/HTTPS results
      http_results.txt     # Content of HTTP pages
      https_results.txt    # Content of HTTPS pages
```

### Explanation of Files and Directories

1. **`ips.txt`**:
   - Contains a list of discovered IP addresses and their corresponding ports (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1:80`, `https://192.168.1.1:443`).

2. **`scanner_session.json`**:
   - Tracks the state of the session, including which CIDR ranges have been completed and which are in progress. This allows the scan to be resumed if interrupted.

3. **`masscan/`**:
   - Stores the raw output files generated by Masscan for each CIDR range scanned. Files are named in the format `masscan_CIDR.json`.

4. **`screenshots/`**:
   - Contains screenshots of web pages taken by **Knulleye**. Screenshots are saved with filenames derived from the URLs (e.g., `scr_192_168_1_1_http.png`).

5. **`results/`**:
   - Contains the fetched content of HTTP and HTTPS pages:
     - `http_results.txt`: Content of HTTP pages (port 80).
     - `https_results.txt`: Content of HTTPS pages (port 443).

### Using Session Names

The `session_name` parameter is used to create a unique directory for each session or project. This allows you to run multiple scans or projects without overwriting data. For example:

- If you run **Knull** with `session_name=project1`, all output will be stored in `Sessions/project1/`.
- If you run **Knulleye** with `session_name=project1`, it will look for `ips.txt` and save screenshots in `Sessions/project1/screenshots/`.

### Example Workflow

1. **Run Knull**:
   ```bash
   ./knull.py cidr_ranges.txt project1
   ```
   - This creates the directory `Sessions/project1/` and stores all scan results there.

2. **Run Knulleye**:
   ```bash
   ./knulleye.py project1
   ```
   - This reads `ips.txt` from `Sessions/project1/` and saves screenshots in `Sessions/project1/screenshots/`.

3. **Resume a Session**:
   - If the scan is interrupted, you can rerun **Knull** with the same `session_name` to resume from where it left off.

### Benefits of Session Management

- **Isolation**: Each session is stored in its own directory, preventing data from different projects from mixing.
- **Resumability**: The `scanner_session.json` file allows scans to be resumed after interruptions.
- **Organization**: All related files (IPs, results, screenshots) are stored in a structured way, making it easy to analyze and share results.

This session-based approach ensures that your scans and projects are well-organized, easy to manage, and resumable.

## Docker Integration

To simplify setup and ensure a consistent environment, this project includes a **Dockerfile** that allows you to run **Knull** and **Knulleye** inside a Docker container. This is particularly useful if you want to avoid installing dependencies directly on your system or if you need to run the tools in an isolated environment.

### Prerequisites

Before using Docker, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Install Docker by following the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Building the Docker Image

1. **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laudarch/knull.git
   cd knull
   python3 -m venv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t knull.
   ```

   This will create a Docker image named `knull` with all the necessary dependencies installed.

### Running the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container interactively or execute specific commands.

#### Interactive Mode

To start an interactive shell inside the container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm knull
```

From here, you can run any of the scripts (e.g., `knull.py`, `knulleye.py`, `tools/count_ips.sh`, `tools/extract_cidr.sh`) as needed.

#### Running Specific Commands

To run a specific command directly, use the following syntax:
```bash
docker run -it --rm knull ./knull.py cidr_ranges.txt session_name
docker run -it --rm knull ./knulleye.py session_name
docker run -it --rm knull ./tools/count_ips.sh cidr_ranges.txt
docker run -it --rm knull ./tools/extract_cidr.sh input_file output_file
```

### Persisting Session Data

To persist session data (e.g., scan results, screenshots) between container runs, you can use Docker volumes. For example:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/sessions:/app/sessions knull
```

This will mount the `sessions` directory from your host machine to the `/app/sessions` directory inside the container, ensuring that session data is saved even after the container is stopped.

### Notes

- **Headless Mode**: The Docker container is configured to run Chrome in headless mode, which is ideal for server environments.
- **Resource Limits**: If you're scanning large networks, consider increasing the container's resource limits (e.g., CPU and memory) using Docker's `--cpus` and `--memory` flags.

### Example Workflow

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t knull .
   ```

2. Run a Masscan and fetch web content:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/sessions:/app/sessions knull./knull.py cidr_ranges.txt session_name
   ```

3. Take screenshots of the discovered URLs:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/sessions:/app/sessions knull./knulleye.py session_name
   ```

4. Count IPs in a CIDR file:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm knull./count_ips.sh cidr_ranges.txt
   ```

5. Extract CIDR blocks from a file:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm knull./extract_cidr.sh input_file output_file
   ```

Using Docker ensures a clean and reproducible environment for running **Knull** and **Knulleye**, making it easier to manage dependencies and share the project with others.
